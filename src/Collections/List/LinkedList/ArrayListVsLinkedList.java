             ArrayList:-Implemented with the concept of dynamic array.
             LinkedList:-Implemented with the concept of doubly linked list.

             Insertions are easy and fast in LinkedList as compared to ArrayList
             Removal also better in LinkedList than ArrayList
             LinkedList has more memory overhead than ArrayList because in ArrayList each index only
holds actual object (data) but in case of LinkedList each node holds both data and address
of next and previous node.

            Both LinkedList and ArrayList require O(n) time to find if an element is present or not. However we can do Binary Search on ArrayList if it is sorted and therefore can search in O(Log n) time.
